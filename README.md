## Hi Daniil! Your first task will be to make a desktop based on the Figma layout.
Initially, we will work step by step.
1) Making the desktop.
2) Review.
3) Feedback.
4) Bugfix
5) Mobile version
6) Review.
7) Feedback.
8) Bugfix.
9) Finalization.

In the !!!source!!! branch there will be a gulp-builder, in it there is a readme file on how to run everything. !!!You need to merge the source branch into the main at the start. What will not be clear - contact me.

Please no ChatGpt and so on. We need to know your real level. And fill in your knowledge gaps. It's crucial.

The structure of the git:

main - development - then your working branches. In main we can only merge the finished project.

I recommend you familiarize yourself with the layout in detail from the beginning. 
Estimate an approximate timeframe for the task, and try to fit it in. Highlight overused components, repetitive blocks, and so on.



Good luck)
